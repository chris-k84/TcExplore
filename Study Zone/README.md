## Motivation

So much of growing as a professional is self study, there are people who have brought together listings of interesting tutorials, books, courses etc. Hopefully by providing more resources we will increase the pool and spread of these useful sources.

## The Goal

The Goal of this repository is to provide a space to list all the useful tools, tutorials, books, courses, videos that have been developed by others to educate and help the community. The more we add here the more this list can be usefully shared and provide those learning easier access to information.

## How To Use

The How to use file shows what to do and links to the already made samples, happy coding.
