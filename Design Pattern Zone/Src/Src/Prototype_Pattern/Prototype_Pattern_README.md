# Prototype Pattern

## The Prototype Pattern for Recipe Management

This sample was created to show the Prototype Pattern applied to TwinCAT, specifically here we are applying the prototype pattern to a recipe management application.

Lets take the example of an application where we have a series of steps, like a CNC type application, we have a set of pre made recipes for positions to create a pattern from the machine. No say we want to add some more points, or create an entirely new recipe. How might we don this?

You can find an explanation of the pattern here:
