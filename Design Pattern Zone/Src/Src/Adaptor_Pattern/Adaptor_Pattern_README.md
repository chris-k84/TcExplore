# Adaptor Pattern

## The Adaptor Pattern for 

This sample was created to show the Adaptor Pattern applied to TwinCAT, in this case we have a TwinSAFE object which is relied upon by a whole machine.


You can find an explanation of the pattern here:

*[PatternGuru - Adaptor Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adaptor)*

and a very good tutorial here:

*[Chris O - Observer Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PKQtcJjYvc)*

To run the sample, go into the TwinSAFEGroup and change the ActTwinSAFEState, you will see the update passed to the Motion and Control objects.
