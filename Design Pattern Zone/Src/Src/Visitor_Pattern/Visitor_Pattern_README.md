# Visitor Pattern

## The Visitor Pattern for 

This sample was created to show the Visitor Pattern applied to TwinCAT, specifically a scenario where you have a series of objects where you have a common behaviour that changes for the user. In this case a status reporting operation, each object wants to output a status message, but each user wants a different method. 

You can find an explanation of the pattern here:

and a very good tutorial here (not my usual Chris Okhravi - But Ben Harrison)
