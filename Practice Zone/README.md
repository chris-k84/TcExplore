## Motivation

This zone is set out for people to practice PLC programming with a series of guided samples provided by the book 'Collection of Exercises for PLC'. The motivation si simply to show a series of possible solutions to common PLC programming problems, the point is not to present the 'correct' answer, but to present an answer, which can then foster discussion and debate. 

## The Goal

The Goal of this repository is to provide solutions to the examples from the book and allow discussions as to what/how they have been implemented. Hopefully providing a space where people will commit their own solutions to add to the core knowledge and resources available to those looking to learn PLC programming. If nothing else my goal is to increase the community resources out there for people to work with and hopefully contribute to the developemnt of others.

## How To Use

The How to use file shows what to do and links to the already made samples, happy coding.
