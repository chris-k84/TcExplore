# Practice Zone

## How To Use the Zone

So you've read the README, you know what this zone is for. This area is for using the 'Collection of exercises for PLC' to provide solution examples to common PLC programming problems.

If you already have solutions, thats great feel free to add clean versions (im not asking for secrets here).

Create a PLC project within the existing solution, we will have a PLC project for each chapter in the book, I have already added the first for the logic circuit exercises, if you are skipping ahead (naughty!!) then add a PLC project for that section and we can go from there.

Within that plc project create a readme for the exercises so we can see what ones have already been done, it might be that some are just extensions of others so cover a few exercises with the same code.

## PLC Practice Examples

Recently (at time of writting) Tom Antonsen released his book 'Collection of exercises for PLC' which contains 100 exercises from beginner to advanced level.

It seems a perfect start to a practice zone.

Here is a list of the exercises so you can see how they can be solved.

When you create a project or add some code to one, please list it locally in the readme, here i want links to the project readmes so we can easily link the elements together and navigate around but topics of interest.
