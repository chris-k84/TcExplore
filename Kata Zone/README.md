## Motivation

This zone is set out for people to recommend/take ideas for code katas. Programming like any other discipline you wish to excel at requires practice. For this reason the industry has 'aquired' the term Kata from Karate. Simply put Kata is the process of repeating a form again and again until you achieve mastery of that form. Each iteration leads to reflection and improvment until this is achieved. The same principal can be applied to programming, instead of using projects to hone the coding skills software developers use Katas. These allow you to practice, typing, code techniques, hot keys, code archetecture, design. Some have physical output, others are just throught exercises. But the end result is to improve the skills required to do the job.

## The Goal

The Goal of this repository is to accumulate a series of code Katas that we as Automation Software Developers can use to improve skills. I want to assemble a library so those new to the industry have a repository of exercises to help them make the jump from learning the basics of how-to in industrial automation, to being a useful team member.
