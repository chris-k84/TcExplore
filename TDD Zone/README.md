## Motivation

A lot of people have done topics concerning Unit Testing (UT) and Test Driven Development (TDD). People like **[Jakob Sagatowski](https://alltwincat.com/2017/11/02/test-driven-development-in-twincat-part-1/)**. These hit with varying levels of impact, i have recently been investigating (procrastinating) and found a number fo reasons for this, they are summed up nicely in the video by **[David Farley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsbMNWW-hdY)**. In a world as heavily regulated and tested as ours we could remove a lot of the burden using this programming practice.

## The Goal

The Goal of this repository is to provide a space to allow people to learn the TDD process. I am hoping those with experience will help those learning these practices. At least it will provide a place where those of us beginning this journey can compare and contrast the results of doing this.

## How To Use

The How to use file shows what to do and links to the already made samples, happy coding.
